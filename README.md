A selection of images generated from a stable diffusion 1.5 instance trained on my face. DeepJakes, if you will.

### A
Used a modified version of the colab notebook found at


https://github.com/TheLastBen/fast-stable-diffusion


And trained it on 37 512 x 512 selfies.

### LIMITATIONS

Does not do eyes or hands very well. This is probably a result of problems inherent to the version of stable diffusion that I was using and the poor quality of the training data utilised.



Does not process expressions other than mild indifference very well because they were not included in the training set.


Asking for a portait of a smiling [TOKEN_NAME] produced horrifying results.
